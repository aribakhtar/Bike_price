# Bike_price
In this project, we are using the language Python for Data exploration and analysis. I searched for a dataset on prices of used motor cycles from all over India .

The first part of studying the dataset is Exploratory Data Analysis. We do so by cleaning the dataset by using appropriate means. Then we draw various charts to recognise the patterns between different columns of the dataset.

The next part is splitting the dataset into training and testing parts and applying a good ML algorithm to predict the testing data.

The final part is to predict the price of my motorcycle using the algorithm which we ran on our training data.
